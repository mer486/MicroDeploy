# MicroDeploy
#Project Overview
This project showcases a full-stack microservices architecture designed to deploy a RESTful API connected to database. Through this setup, we aim to explore how microservices, containerization, and CI/CD can enhance scalability, flexibility, and efficiency in deploying modern applications.

#Objectives
Our primary goals with this project include:
Building a robust REST API with CRUD operations to manage AdventureWorks data.
Deploying the API and database within Docker containers to streamline development and deployment.
Implementing a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying the application for a seamless development experience.

#Technology Stack
The project leverages the following technologies:
Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core
Database: MS SQL Server (AdventureWorks sample database)
Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
CI/CD: Jenkins pipeline for automated builds and deployments
